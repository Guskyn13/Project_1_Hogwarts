WELCOME TO THE SORTING HAT!

As many of you know there are four houses at Hogwarts. The house of Gryfiinfor values bravery,daring,nerve, and chivalry. House of Hufflepuff values hard work, dedication, patience,loyalty, and fairplay. The House of Ravenclaw values intelligence, knowledge,curiosity, creativity, and wit. House Slytherin values ambition, leadership, slef-preservation,cunning, and resourcefulness. 

During our Module 1 at Flatirons School, we were asking to build a CLI APP. We choose to go with an app that will sort new students into their houses at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardary. 

With this app, we promise that you will get a fair sorting of the class that will better suit you and here is how.

OUR FIRST STEPS
- We began by creating our basic layout of files, installation of gems, and setting up our environment. 
- From there we began working in vertical slices to complete our code.

OUR LAST STEPS
- For our last stops we work with tty-propts to pretty up our app
- We also worked with afplay to add some fun audio to the app. Our code looked like this : 

def play_music
      pid = fork{ exec 'afplay', "Harry_Potter_Theme_Song_Hedwigs_Theme (mp3cut.net).mp3" }
   end
